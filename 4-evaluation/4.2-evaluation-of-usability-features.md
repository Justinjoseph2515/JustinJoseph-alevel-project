# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                      | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | have a simple objective -  get to the exit to complete the level | success      |
| 2           | complete the levels fast as possible and beat the previous time  | sucess       |

### Feature 1

The exit portal is simple way for the player to idenfit the end of the level and the start of the subsequent level. By having the exit portal it provide the player with a simple idea of what the objective of the game is. Therefore this feature more or less would stay and does not need to be change until a better design of the overall game can be found

### Feature 2

With the addition of the stopwatch it  makes the game more  effective as the player are motivated to do better then before when player the game whilst   to collect the coin , get though the level whilst avoiding the obsolesces.  I see this as an essential part of the game and it can not be removed or altered.&#x20;

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                     | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a menu system that is quick and easy to navigate through | success      |
|             |                                                                 |              |

### Feature 1

The menu system implement in the game is efficient as it keep the design minimalist allowing the player to navigate through the menu with ease. The menu system will be kept in place for any later date development .

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a series of levels to work through | success      |
| 2           | The game should be visually appealing     | success      |

### Feature 1

Having the a series of levels will keep the players entertain as well as engaged. This can be extend the player engagement the current level can be improved up on by have bigger levels and additional levels. this could be added in future development.

### Feature 2

Having the game visually appealing enables the player to be engaged for longer. From asking others in person and through surveys it appears with simple bright colours used that have successfully been achieved. I aim to keep the same colour and the same retro cartoonish design down the line in terms of future development.



## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                                        | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | <ul><li>The game doesn't crash</li></ul>                           | success      |
| 2           | The game does not contain any bugs that damage the user experience | fail         |

### Feature 1

The game did not crash this has made the error tolerance to be very high thus making it successful. I aim to carry this on future development of the game , where the game can be put under any level of stress and still work with out fail.

### Feature 2

Despite the game running with out crashing there are bug in the game that the  players can find annoying thus degrading the players experience ( which has lead to this erroe tolence being marked as fail). However even tho it could degrade the players experience it would not repel the user from playing the game as those are small issue such as the hitboxs of the coins and obstacle overlapping . Additional it found during the survey that the test player still enjoyed the game despite have the bugs.



## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                              | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | provide enough help / guidance on how to successfully complete the game  | success      |
| 2           | have simple enough control that the player can understand them easily    | success      |

### Feature 1

When asking individuals around me to play the game without reading the rules they understood the objective of the game in under 6 minutes , however there is also an option in the menu for the rules of the game to outline the controls and the objective of it . I aim to keep the game this simple down the line when development the game future

### Feature 2

The controls used in the game was easy to learn leading to the feature being marked as a success .This was made clear in the usability testing with the test player agree the easy of use of the controls of A,D and space. The control used will kept even down the line even when new development is underway.&#x20;
