# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* multiplayer mode - currently the game can only be played by one player off line because no         multiplayer was created
* number of levels - there are only two levels for the game with the target&#x20;
* more advanced obstacles - Even tho there obstacles that the player has to over come to get to the exit. More advanced obstacle will be an added bonus to the game&#x20;
* character ability - the character should have the ability to attach the enemy&#x20;
* health bar - due to the time constrains of the project i feature that was wanted was to add a health bar the game , but this was never achieved&#x20;

## Maintenance



#### space for growth&#x20;

For the game to advance it would first be required to go through the short-term development plan in order to be free of bugs. Once in good shape the development can continue. New features will start to be added to the game when a long-term plan to develop the game is created , which will expand the project's programming code. The project's present limitations that must be looked over and changed in order for the game to advance. This will help determine how far the game can be developed and what new features it might eventually add.

&#x20;For the game to progress there is potential that a group people would be needed because, during this process the game would expand to a size that will make managing it and be able to continuously  release improvement   difficult for a single individual to handle . When I wrote the code, I made an consistent effort to make it as easy to understand as possible by adding comments along the way. But before programmers  can help with programming , the programmers would  may need to undergo training before being capable of coding in kaboom.js  as some some may not have the experience needed to code in kabaoom.js.

Lastly, to help the game grow an additional team members can be enlisted to help with locating and resolving issues ( mainly bugs) as well as putting new features into the game. Team members can work on various game components as the code base grows, ensuring that all game components are being developed concurrently. This is crucial since more players will probably result in higher demand for game development and enhancements.&#x20;

## Future Development

### Short Term plan&#x20;

### Bug Fixes&#x20;

* The overlapping of the hit box between the coins and obstacles - To solve this bug I would place the coins far enough away from the obstacles so that each of the hitbox does not overlap but instead are just next to each other. Another solution to this bug would e to make the obstacles and coin smaller this means that they can stay in the same place by with a smaller hit box
* The moving platforms - To solve the moving platform bug where if the player intercept the moving platform the side, the platform with bonus of the player and go back the way it came from , i would alter the design of the platform by adding side spikes to the moving platform thus by adding the spikes if the player touch the side whilst trying to get onto the platform they will lose there live
* Slower performance - Mentioned in the 3.2 usability test after the game run the game itself will slow down to solve this bug i would try simplify the code even more so it takes less time for the computer to run the code with its limited resources
* stopwatch - to solve the bug of the stopwatch i would make the word "stopwatch " and the stopwatch counter  separate from each other after which i can position them with the (pos()) function individually

#### health bar





### Long Term  Addressing Limitations

The game's restrictions will prevent it from developing further. The main areas of focus for future game development will be these constraints.

#### current limitations

The game's restrictions will prevent it from developing further. The main areas of focus for future game development will be these :

* Levels - This limitation can be address by build more levels since the basics needed for the additional levels is already setup ( this is shown in cycle 7).
* graphics - This limitation can be addressed by getting a design artist to do  the grpaich need for the game&#x20;
* platform suport - This limitation can be solved by allow different inputs and creating a stand alone application for the game to be played from&#x20;
