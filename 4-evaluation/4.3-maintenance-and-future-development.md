# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* multiplayer mode - currently the game can only be played by one player off line because no         multiplayer was created
* number of levels - there are only two levels for the game with the target&#x20;
* more advanced obstacles - Even tho there obstacles that the player has to over come to get to the exit. More advanced obstacle will be an added bonus to the game&#x20;
* character ability - the character should have the ability to attach the enemy&#x20;
* health bar - due to the time constrains of the project i feature that was wanted was to add a health bar the game , but this was never achieved&#x20;

## Maintenance

For the game to grow it would first be required to go through the short-term development plan in order to be free of bugs. Once in good shape the development can continue. New features will start to be added to the game when a long-term play to develop the game is created , which will expand the project's programming code. The project's present limitations that must be looked over and changed in order for the game to advance. This will help determine how far the game can be developed and what new features it might eventually add.

&#x20;For the game to progress a group of about four people would be needed because, during this process the game would expand to a size that will make managing it and be able to continuously  release improvement   difficult for a single individual to handle . When I wrote the code, I made an consistent effort to make it as easy to understand as possible by adding comments along the way. But before programmers  can help with programming , the programmer would  may need to undergo training before being capable of coding in kaboom.js  as some some may not have the experience needed to code in kabaoom.js.

Lastly, to help the game grow an additional team members can be enlisted to help with locating and resolving issues ( mainly bugs) as well as putting new features into the game. Team members can work on various game components as the code base grows, ensuring that all game components are being developed concurrently. This is crucial since more players will probably result in higher demand for game development and enhancements.&#x20;
