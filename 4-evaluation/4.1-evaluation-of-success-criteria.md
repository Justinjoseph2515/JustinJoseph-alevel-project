### Criteria

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                 | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | when was it achieved                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Platforms                                                                 | This is to provide the player with a path to get to the exit whilst avoiding obstacles and have varying length to add complexity to the game                                                                                                                                              | Achieved in cycle 1                     |
| 2        | A minimum of 2 levels of equal size                                       | This is to provide the player a joyful gaming experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Achieved in cycle 7                     |
| 3        | The levels get progressively more difficult                               | By making the levels progressively more difficult, it provides the player more of a challenge to get to the exit as well as not making the game trivial, which allows for more fun                                                                                                        | Achieved in cycle 7 , usability testing |
| 4        | The moving platforms should enable the player to move between platforms   | By adding a moving platform, the game  provides the player with more of a risk factor such that if the player misses the jump on to or when jumping off it the player can fall and die                                                                                                    | Achieved in cycle 9                     |
| 5        | Break away platforms                                                      | By adding break away platforms the player will not be given the opportunity to spend an excessive amount of time on one platform thus making the player think on their feet on what their next move is going to be                                                                        | It was not Achieved                     |
| 6        | Have a portal/exit  to take the player to the next level                  | The justification for a portal to next level is for a simplification factor. By having portals it makes it an easier transition to the next level instead of exiting the game and going to a new level. This provides the player with a better game play experience without the hindrance | Achieved in cycle 6                     |

| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 8        | Having simple controls  | By having simple control (such as W,A,S,D) it will make it easy to understand movement of the  character which means that more time can be spent playing the game instead of learning the controls             | This was achieved in cycle 1           |
| 9        | Scrolling camera        | When the player is moving in any direction the camera should keep the player in frame and make sure that the player does not go off the screen                                                                 | This was achieved in cycle 2           |
| 10       | Double jump             | The game should have double jump to allow the player to get to the next platform whilst being able to avoid the obstacles                                                                                      | This was achieved in cycle 1           |
| 11       | Player collision        | When the player comes in contact with an obstacle or an enemy the player should take damage to their health, subsequently leading to death if they undergo too many collisions                                 | This was achieved in cycle 2,3,5 and 6 |
| 12       | Gravity                 | This is to provide the game with more of a realistic factor which will improve the game experience of the player                                                                                               | This was achieved in cycle 1 and 8     |
| 13       | Coins system            | The player should be able to collect the coins during playing the level and the coins collected should be displayed whilst playing the game. This will be done when the player comes in contact with the coins | This was achieved in cycle 2           |
| 14       | Health bar              | The health bar is used to indicate the player at what stage of health their character is at. This means that the player can be more cautious to not collide with objects (e.g spikes)                          | This was not  achieved                 |

| 15 | Simple Menu                                         | When the player enters the game they should be presented with a simple menu that gives the option to play the game or tell the player the rules                                          | This was achieved in cycle 8 and 10  |
| 16 | Pause button                                        | The addition of a pause button during the game enables the player to take a break and rejoin when the player feels like it                                                               | This was not achieved                |
| 17 | Stopwatch                                           | By having an optional stopwatch, the player can be able to see how fast they can complete the level. This also gives the player some incentive to do better than before by trying again  | This was achieved in cycle 4         |
| 18 | A background that appeals to the player             | By adding a background that is welcoming, a better gaming experience is provided                                                                                                         | This was achieved in cycle 1         |
| 19 | Game scene when the player wins and loses (or dies) | This allows the player to know whether they have completed the game or if they should retry it                                                                                           | This was achieved in cycles 6 and 9  |

| 21       | Should be age appropriate pegi 12                | By making the game without blood, shooting or with any inappropriate graphics but with minimal violence it can be categorized as PEGI 12 | This was achieved in [3.2](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md) Usability Testing                                      |
| 22       | Should have no errors whilst the code is running | This prevents the game from crashing which doesn't disconnect the player from their immersion                                            | This was achieved in 3.1 Testing for Function and robustness as well as 3.2 Usability Testing                            |
