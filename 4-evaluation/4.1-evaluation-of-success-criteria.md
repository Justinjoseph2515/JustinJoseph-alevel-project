| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                 | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | when was it achieved                    |

| 1        | Platforms                                                                 | This is to provide the player with a path to get to the exit whilst avoiding obstacles and have varying length to add complexity to the game                                                                                                                                              | Achieved in cycle 1                     |
| 2        | A minimum of 5 levels of equal size                                       | This is to provide the player a joyful gaming experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not achieved                            |
| 3        | The levels get progressively more difficult                               | By making the levels progressively more difficult, it provides the player more of a challenge to get to the exit as well as not making the game trivial, which allows for more fun                                                                                                        | Achieved in cycle 7 , usability testing |
| 4        | The moving platforms should enable the player to move between platforms   | By adding a moving platform, the game  provides the player with more of a risk factor such that if the player misses the jump on to or when jumping off it the player can fall and die                                                                                                    | Achieved in cycle 9                     |
| 5        | Break away platforms                                                      | By adding break away platforms the player will not be given the opportunity to spend an excessive amount of time on one platform thus making the player think on their feet on what their next move is going to be                                                                        | It was not Achieved                     |
| 6        | Have a portal/exit  to take the player to the next level                  | The justification for a portal to next level is for a simplification factor. By having portals it makes it an easier transition to the next level instead of exiting the game and going to a new level. This provides the player with a better game play experience without the hindrance | Achieved in cycle 6                     |
| 7        | the level should have enemies                                             | These will be progressively introduced into the levels where they appear spontaneously at specific areas of the levels. This is to provide the player with additional obstacles / challenges to overcome whilst playing the game .                                                        | Achieved in cycle 5 and 7               |

## criterion 1&#x20;

## criterion 2

Due to time constrains l only created 2 out of 5 levels i had player. With the level created being large enable thus allowing the player to explore the levels freely.&#x20;

## criterion 3&#x20;

There is clear sign of progressively difficulty as features that I considered challenging or difficult for the player were slowly introduced in subsequent levels such as moving acid baths and enemy. Additionally to ensure that I took the correct approach I tested this level design in the usability testing.

## criterion 4

l have added a moving platform to my game which is shown in cycle 9. know that successfully achieved my set criteria i became more creative and proceed to make an alteration with the use the same code this lead me to create the acid bath thus providing the player with an additional challenge.

## criterion 5

I initially wanted to add the breakaway platform as a feature so that when the player stood on the breakaway platform and then jumped off it to another platform the previous platform would break away. I was not able to fulfill this success certia due two reason.The first reason by due to the lack of time i hand on my hands to complete this. In which i saw that the time could be better spend to complete other much need aspect of the game that was listed in the success certia and instead i interpreted the break away platform as a add on feature. Secondly, was my lack of understand on how to implement this feature successfully. I had many attempts at typing even though I managed get some part of the feature work destroying the platform. It did not work in the way that was not intended by me.

## criterion 6

From the image/ video above it is aparetn the feature is has worked where by it takes the player to the next level on they have get the protal. It is also a way to fully comptete the level as it will defiently tell the player when they have complted the all the level with a win scene.

## criterion  7

This criterion has been achieved in cycle 7 where the enemy is introduced. The objectives of the first level is to let the player climatise with the game whilst the second level makes the game more interesting the enemy ability is limited but functions for the level it is at. When planning for the level and the game the idea around the enemy is that it gets progressively hard as the player goes through each level.&#x20;

| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 8        | Having simple controls  | By having simple control (such as W,A,S,D) it will make it easy to understand movement of the  character which means that more time can be spent playing the game instead of learning the controls             | This was achieved in cycle 1           |
| 9        | Scrolling camera        | When the player is moving in any direction the camera should keep the player in frame and make sure that the player does not go off the screen                                                                 | This was achieved in cycle 2           |
| 10       | Double jump             | The game should have double jump to allow the player to get to the next platform whilst being able to avoid the obstacles                                                                                      | This was achieved in cycle 1           |
| 11       | Player collision        | When the player comes in contact with an obstacle or an enemy the player should take damage to their health, subsequently leading to death if they undergo too many collisions                                 | This was achieved in cycle 2,3,5 and 6 |
| 12       | Gravity                 | This is to provide the game with more of a realistic factor which will improve the game experience of the player                                                                                               | This was achieved in cycle 1 and 8     |
| 13       | Coins system            | The player should be able to collect the coins during playing the level and the coins collected should be displayed whilst playing the game. This will be done when the player comes in contact with the coins | This was achieved in cycle 2           |
| 14       | Health bar              | The health bar is used to indicate the player at what stage of health their character is at. This means that the player can be more cautious to not collide with objects (e.g spikes)                          | This was not  achieved                 |

| 15 | Simple Menu                                         | When the player enters the game they should be presented with a simple menu that gives the option to play the game or tell the player the rules                                          | This was achieved in cycle 8 and 10  |
| 16 | Pause button                                        | The addition of a pause button during the game enables the player to take a break and rejoin when the player feels like it                                                               | This was not achieved                |

| 18 | A background that appeals to the player             | By adding a background that is welcoming, a better gaming experience is provided                                                                                                         | This was achieved in cycle 1         |
