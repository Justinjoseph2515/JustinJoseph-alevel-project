### Criteria

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                 | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | when was it achieved                    |

| 1        | Platforms                                                                 | This is to provide the player with a path to get to the exit whilst avoiding obstacles and have varying length to add complexity to the game                                                                                                                                              | Achieved in cycle 1                     |
| 2        | A minimum of 5 levels of equal size                                       | This is to provide the player a joyful gaming experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Not achieved                            |
| 3        | The levels get progressively more difficult                               | By making the levels progressively more difficult, it provides the player more of a challenge to get to the exit as well as not making the game trivial, which allows for more fun                                                                                                        | Achieved in cycle 7 , usability testing |
| 4        | The moving platforms should enable the player to move between platforms   | By adding a moving platform, the game  provides the player with more of a risk factor such that if the player misses the jump on to or when jumping off it the player can fall and die                                                                                                    | Achieved in cycle 9                     |
| 5        | Break away platforms                                                      | By adding break away platforms the player will not be given the opportunity to spend an excessive amount of time on one platform thus making the player think on their feet on what their next move is going to be                                                                        | It was not Achieved                     |
| 6        | Have a portal/exit  to take the player to the next level                  | The justification for a portal to next level is for a simplification factor. By having portals it makes it an easier transition to the next level instead of exiting the game and going to a new level. This provides the player with a better game play experience without the hindrance | Achieved in cycle 6                     |
| 7        | the level should have enemies                                             | These will be progressively introduced into the levels where they appear spontaneously at specific areas of the levels. This is to provide the player with additional obstacles / challenges to overcome whilst playing the game .                                                        | Achieved in cycle 5 and 7               |

###

## criterion 1&#x20;

From the image above it shows therenare many different way for the player to get to the exit with out dieing.this is prodomeanly due to the platfrom placed in a way that give gap to jump through . This was alls tested usability testin with the test player coming to the same conconlustion. Overall i consider the sucess certia has been met.

## criterion 2

Due to time constrains l only created 2 out of 5 levels i had player. With the level created being large enable thus allowing the player to explore the levels freely.&#x20;

## criterion 3&#x20;

There is clear sign of progressively difficulty as features that I considered challenging or difficult for the player were slowly introduced in subsequent levels such as moving acid baths and enemy. Additionally to ensure that I took the correct approach I tested this level design in the usability testing.

## criterion 4

l have added a moving platform to my game which is shown in cycle 9. know that successfully achieved my set criteria i became more creative and proceed to make an alteration with the use the same code this lead me to create the acid bath thus providing the player with an additional challenge.

## criterion 5

I initially wanted to add the breakaway platform as a feature so that when the player stood on the breakaway platform and then jumped off it to another platform the previous platform would break away. I was not able to fulfill this success certia due two reason.The first reason by due to the lack of time i hand on my hands to complete this. In which i saw that the time could be better spend to complete other much need aspect of the game that was listed in the success certia and instead i interpreted the break away platform as a add on feature. Secondly, was my lack of understand on how to implement this feature successfully. I had many attempts at typing even though I managed get some part of the feature work destroying the platform. It did not work in the way that was not intended by me.

## criterion 6

From the image/ video above it is apparent the feature is has worked where by it takes the player to the next level on they have get the protal. It is also a way to fully comptete the level as it will defiently tell the player when they have complted the all the level with a win scene.

## criterion  7

This criterion has been achieved in cycle 7 where the enemy is introduced. The objectives of the first level is to let the player climatise with the game whilst the second level makes the game more interesting the enemy ability is limited but functions for the level it is at. When planning for the level and the game the idea around the enemy is that it gets progressively hard as the player goes through each level. As you can see from the video above the enemy when introduced for the second level it moves between tow set point by the my in the level code.

| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 8        | Having simple controls  | By having simple control (such as W,A,S,D) it will make it easy to understand movement of the  character which means that more time can be spent playing the game instead of learning the controls             | This was achieved in cycle 1           |
| 9        | Scrolling camera        | When the player is moving in any direction the camera should keep the player in frame and make sure that the player does not go off the screen                                                                 | This was achieved in cycle 2           |
| 10       | Double jump             | The game should have double jump to allow the player to get to the next platform whilst being able to avoid the obstacles                                                                                      | This was achieved in cycle 1           |
| 11       | Player collision        | When the player comes in contact with an obstacle or an enemy the player should take damage to their health, subsequently leading to death if they undergo too many collisions                                 | This was achieved in cycle 2,3,5 and 6 |
| 12       | Gravity                 | This is to provide the game with more of a realistic factor which will improve the game experience of the player                                                                                               | This was achieved in cycle 1 and 8     |
| 13       | Coins system            | The player should be able to collect the coins during playing the level and the coins collected should be displayed whilst playing the game. This will be done when the player comes in contact with the coins | This was achieved in cycle 2           |
| 14       | Health bar              | The health bar is used to indicate the player at what stage of health their character is at. This means that the player can be more cautious to not collide with objects (e.g spikes)                          | This was not  achieved                 |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## criterion 8&#x20;

I have provide the character with movement in the three direction by using a for left ,d for right and space for jump as well another feature which will be explained in criterion 10  with the four direction (down or falling ) coming form the use of gravity in my game&#x20;

## criterion 9

Since i had planned for my levels to be done on a large scale it was a much need to requiemtn that the characters  of the game has scrolling camera that would follow the player any direction they when in order to reach the exit as the player could not see the whole level . With the successful implementation of the scrolling camera the player can be followed the start to finsh  whilst providing a limited viewing field which was mention in 1.4a.

## criterion 10&#x20;

The double jump was feature that allows the player to jump from the another platfrom with greater distance then a stanard jump It was successfully implentment with the controls A,D and space. BY using the space bar as for the regular jump and the double jump it made easier for the player to understand it  as well as be convenient.&#x20;

## criterion 11

The use of coiliosn can be found in many place in my development cycles. I have prodoment used the coilison function as way for the game to take action against the player. example of this would be colllecting the coins , or when the player comes in contct with a obstcles. As review the development cycles it can be said that the use of coillion was succesgful implented into the game.

## criterion 12

Dispite the fact that gravity is present in the game it was never coded in to the game by me but instead it result of the me coding for the jumping and its force which lead to the kaboom.js using the jump force as the gravity forces. Which i consider to be a sucess and has met the need og teh sucess certia

## criterion 13



From the planning phase of this game i soret out a way to implentmetn a coin system to provide the player with an addtioaln purpose instead just geting to the exit. From the image you can see it has been  sucesfull added and  functioaln as well as meeting all the aspect of the sucess certia. With a issue that was later suported in the 3.2 usabillity testing &#x20;



## criterion 14

The health bar was indeted as a way for players to see the state of the charater as well as the enemey this was planned with the idea that the enemy has the abilty to shoot and it was the player objectiv to get to the exit whilst being ablet o take the enmeies out. I was not able to meet this sucess certia for the reason lack of time as well as poratiesing other funcitonal that could effect the game overall quailty.&#x20;

| 15 | Simple Menu                                         | When the player enters the game they should be presented with a simple menu that gives the option to play the game or tell the player the rules                                          | This was achieved in cycle 8 and 10                  |
| 16 | Pause button                                        | The addition of a pause button during the game enables the player to take a break and rejoin when the player feels like it                                                               | This was not achieved                                |
| 17 | Stopwatch                                           | By having an optional stopwatch, the player can be able to see how fast they can complete the level. This also gives the player some incentive to do better than before by trying again  | This was achieved in cycle 4                         |
| 18 | A background that appeals to the player             | By adding a background that is welcoming, a better gaming experience is provided                                                                                                         | This was achieved in cycle 1  and usability testing  |

### criterion 15

When you load into the game you will be greeted by two large buttons that will take you to the chosen place . The menu provides the game with a look of completeness whilst enabling to add sub features enabling the player to choose what is best for them and not rushing the player into the game but instead allowing them to make the decision. This success criteria was met to a good standard.

### criterion 16

The pause button was a feature that would have allowed the player to temporarily pause the game if they were over-welded by the game or any personal reason. I was not able to implement this feature as I did not understand how to proceed with the feature and how to make it happen successfully . Even though I tried  to create one , it did not function correctly and as I was not keen to provide the player with a bugs game I decided to remove the feature.

### criterion 17

The feature was met in cycle 4 with it being fully functional. The only bug with the stopwatch can be seen in the image above . As you can see the counter and stopwatch are together with no space this is a simple fix and will be done during when fixing the other bug in the game. Overall this criterion was met

### criterion 18

This success sierra was done through a survey during a usability test . with most of the response agreeing that they like the colour and the design of the game . Overall this criterion was met.

### criterion 19

As you can see the game scene in the game was designed in a simple manner as the only purpose for them was to let the player know if they completed the game successfully or not. Overall this criterion was met&#x20;

| 20       | Should run at 30 fps                             | This is ensure that the game can run smoothly without any hindrance which will provide the player with a good gaming experience          | <p>This was achieved in <a href="../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md">3.1</a> testing for function and robustness</p><p> </p> |
| 21       | Should be age appropriate pegi 12                | By making the game without blood, shooting or with any inappropriate graphics but with minimal violence it can be categorized as PEGI 12 | This was achieved in [3.2](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md) Usability Testing                                      |
| 22       | Should have no errors whilst the code is running | This prevents the game from crashing which doesn't disconnect the player from their immersion                                            | This was achieved in 3.1 Testing for Function and robustness as well as 3.2 Usability Testing                            |



## criterion 20

&#x20;This was met in 3.1 testing for function and robustness with me using the in build feature of kaboomns to test the fps of the game and wehn throuaaly testing the game wit added elecemtn the game did not go below 46 fps.

## criterion 21

This sucess certia was used has the question in my survey subsequently the reposes will be in the usability testing. Overall the sercia certia was met&#x20;

## criterion  22

To see if the my game met the need of this sucess certia it was tested in 3.1 and 3.2 . the overall response being that with ran without error but with some bugs.
