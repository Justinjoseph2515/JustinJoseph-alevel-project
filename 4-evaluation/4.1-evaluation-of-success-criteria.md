| Ref. No. | Criterion                                                                 | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | when was it achieved                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Platforms                                                                 | This is to provide the player with a path to get to the exit whilst avoiding obstacles                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Achieved in cycle 1                     |
| 2        | A minimum of 2 levels of equal size                                       | This is to provide the player a joyful gaming experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Achieved in cycle 7                     |
| 3        | The levels get progressively more difficult                               | By making the levels progressively more difficult, it provides the player more of a challenge to get to the exit as well as not making the game trivial, which allows for more fun                                                                                                        | Achieved in cycle 7 , usability testing |
| 4        | The moving platforms should enable the player to move between platforms   | By adding a moving platform, the game  provides the player with more of a risk factor such that if the player misses the jump on to or when jumping off it the player can fall and die                                                                                                    | Achieved in cycle 9                     |
| 5        | Break away platforms                                                      | By adding break away platforms the player will not be given the opportunity to spend an excessive amount of time on one platform thus making the player think on their feet on what their next move is going to be                                                                        | It was not Achieved                     |
| 6        | Have a portal/exit  to take the player to the next level                  | The justification for a portal to next level is for a simplification factor. By having portals it makes it an easier transition to the next level instead of exiting the game and going to a new level. This provides the player with a better game play experience without the hindrance | Achieved in cycle 6                     |
