| 2        | A minimum of 5 levels of equal size                                       | This is to provide the player a joyful gaming experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |  1.4a features of proposed solution |
| 3        | The levels get progressively more difficult                               | By making the levels progressively more difficult, it provides the player more of a challenge to get to the exit as well as not making the game trivial, which allows for more fun                                                                                                        |  1.4a features of proposed solution |
| 4        | The moving platforms should enable the player to move between platforms   | By adding a moving platform, the game  provides the player with more of a risk factor such that if the player misses the jump on to or when jumping off it the player can fall and die                                                                                                    |                                     |
| 5        | Break away platforms                                                      | By adding break away platforms the player will not be given the opportunity to spend an excessive amount of time on one platform thus making the player think on their feet on what their next move is going to be                                                                        |                                     |
| 6        | Have a portal/exit  to take the player to the next level                  | The justification for a portal to next level is for a simplification factor. By having portals it makes it an easier transition to the next level instead of exiting the game and going to a new level. This provides the player with a better game play experience without the hindrance |  1.4a features of proposed solution |

| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 8        | Having simple controls  | By having simple control (such as W,A,S,D) it will make it easy to understand movement of the  character which means that more time can be spent playing the game instead of learning the controls             | 1.3 research ,  1.4a features of proposed solution and  1.4a features of proposed solution |
| 9        | Scrolling camera        | When the player is moving in any direction the camera should keep the player in frame and make sure that the player does not go off the screen                                                                 | 1.3 research                                                                               |
| 10       | Double jump             | The game should have double jump to allow the player to get to the next platform whilst being able to avoid the obstacles                                                                                      |                                                                                            |
| 11       | Player collision        | When the player comes in contact with an obstacle or an enemy the player should take damage to their health, subsequently leading to death if they undergo too many collisions                                 |                                                                                            |
| 12       | Gravity                 | This is to provide the game with more of a realistic factor which will improve the game experience of the player                                                                                               |                                                                                            |
| 13       | Coins system            | The player should be able to collect the coins during playing the level and the coins collected should be displayed whilst playing the game. This will be done when the player comes in contact with the coins | 1.3 research                                                                               |
| 14       | Health bar              | The health bar is used to indicate the player at what stage of health their character is at. This means that the player can be more cautious to not collide with objects (e.g spikes)                          | 1.3 research                                                                               |
