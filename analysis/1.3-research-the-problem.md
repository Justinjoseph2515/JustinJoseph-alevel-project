### Overview&#x20;

Fire boy and water girl is developed in 2009 by Oslo Albert. Comprising 32 levels, the objective of both players is to get to the exit gate without falling into each others' element or falling into the green substance (that looks like acid) whilst jumping on the platforms, pushing blocks onto buttons to unlock doors, and pulling levers. With the ability to be multiplayer, (TBC)



### Aspect 1 (of 2-4 aspects per solution?)

### Controls&#x20;

Being developed for the web browser, the game input controls are simple. The keys: W, A, S, D are allocated for the water girl whilst the arrow keys (↑←↓→) are allocated for the fire boy. I aim to incorporate a similar input button layout method for my video game as it will make it simple for the players to interact.

### Story and design&#x20;

There appears to be not much of a vast storyline in fire boy and water girl. Neither the less it seems to be set in a temple environment to guide the characters out of said temple whilst collecting gems along the way. To complete every level, you would have to solve simple puzzles during the game, such as pushing a block onto a scale or a "see-saw" where the other character can walk up the ramp and continue onwards. As a risk element, the game incorporates pools of liquid whereby each element character can only go through their own element and both of them can not enter a green substance; doing so would lead to immediate death and both players would have to restart the level again.

Moreover, the UI is designed in a mentalistic manner by only proving a pause button and a timer for the duration of the gameplay. The menu in the game provides the player with the option to start the game or go to gaming settings controls. Once entered, the game presents you with a map depicting the levels that you have completed and the next possible route. Finally, after the completion of a level, the colour will indicate how successfully you have completed the level.

| Platforms at different levels | I would like to use platforms at different levels as it provides more opportunity  to collect coins, fight NPCs and provide a longer lasting screen playtime.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 2 player or multiplayer       | By enabling my game to be a 2 player game it benefits the players as it makes the game to be more entertaining as well as being able to encourage socialisation between the players.                                                                                                                                        |
| Buttons and levers            | Helps by adding complexity to the game by making it harder to complete it to also help with the engagement of the players.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Simple controls               | By making the controls simple to interact with it helps the player spend less time learning the controls for the game and instead spend more time playing it game itself. Additionally, it will help the game to run smoothly by having a wired  controller system (keyboard) over a wireless, which reduces the input lag. |

| the lack of ablity to plug in an extra keybord  | even tho fire boy and water girl are meant to be played on one keyboard the game should also give the player the option to add an extra keyboard to help reduce game error as lots of mistakes that happen between the player in the game is because they keep coming in contact of one another  |
| the character elements                          | in my game, I do not see a reason for my character to have to adopt an element as part of the game instead the player will have another sort of character such as a ninja.                                                                                                                       |

## Shadow blade +&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1).png>)

### Overview

Shadow blade + is a fast-paced 2d platformer game, developed by Dead Mage. As part of the game, the player is requested to achieve the objectives that have been set by going through and against obstacles (such as jumping over spikes, fighting bots, and not being vaporized by lasers).&#x20;

### Aspect 1 (of 2-4 aspects per solution?)

### Controls&#x20;

As the game was developed for mobile devices, the controls are done in a simple manner. The player has the choice of either swiping on the screen for movement or an arrow (whilst B is used for jump). To attack the player has the ability to use A. From experience, the use of the mobile controls in Shadow blade + is quite fatiguing to use over an extended period of time. As a result, I wish not to use it.

### Storyline and game design



The storyline of Shadow blade + is based on a young adult who is on a mission to be the next shadow blade ninja. The player is tasked with the objective of getting the ninja character from the start of the level to exit without encountering death whilst defeating NPCs that try to block his path.

Moreover, when playing the game the player is presented with a simple UI displaying a stopwatch at the top centre of the play screen and a pause button on the top right of the play screen. when the game is loaded up the player has the option to go into the game by going through a level section page, displayed in a simple manner it enables easy navigation of the game.

| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time based system                  | The time-based system can go in two different ways: A countdown timer or a stopwatch. The justification for having a countdown timer is so that the player does not spend too much time on a particular section, as well as giving additional pressure to the player which may heighten the gaming experience. Whilst the stopwatch can help the player compare their current performance, with that of their previous game.  |
| NPCs (that can fight back)         |  I would like to incorporate NPCs into my game as they provide a challenge for the player. Furthermore, if the player is by themselves (in single-player mode) they will not feel lonely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Health bar                         | The reason for having a health bar in my video game is to let the player know what health condition the characters are currently in as well as their opponents'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Traps, pits, and moving obstacles  | The reason to include traps, pits, and moving obstacles is to provide additional difficulty. Furthermore, by using traps, pits, and moving obstacles in hidden places, it allows for the player to be "on edge", wondering what could come next.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Screen scrolling                   | By using screen scrolling in my project, I can make the level appear larger than it is. Also, it helps the use of traps, pits and moving obstacles to be more effective as they can't be seen as easily as the would without screen scrolling.                                                                                                                                                                                |

| the endless death system        | Without a death system that has no end until the player completes the level, it will remove one of the risk factors compared to having a limited number of tries before you have failed a level and have to restart the level. |
| the layout                      | The layout in this game is done in such a way that it is too simple. By not constructing a difficult layout, it leads to the player being bored after a short period of time.                                                  |
| the weakness of the bots (npcs) | even tho i am incorporating bots in my game I believe that the bots should take more hits                                                                                                                                      |

### super Mario bros&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)



### Overview

Created by Nintendo in 2009 and intended for the Wii gaming console, the Super Mario Bros is a 2.5d side-scrolling platformer game. The plot of the game is that two brothers, Mario and Luigi, are tasked with the mission of getting to the end of the level map and saving princess Peach. Whilst racing through the mushroom kingdom by jumping on platforms, using power-ups, and eliminating enemies such as King Bowser. The Super Mario bro game series is intended for people above the age of 3.

### Aspect 1 (of 2-4 aspects per solution?)

## Controls

Developed by Nintendo, intended for the Wii gaming console, the controls for the game uses a joystick-style controller. The arrow buttons enable the movement of the characters. Likewise, the two additional buttons control the jumping of the character whilst the other button controls the power-ups lastly, holding the second button will enable sprint mode

### Storyline

Based on a fictional world the brothers are given the objective to save the princess from the evil Bowser. Whilst trying to get to the princess, Mario and Luigi have to go through the mushroom kingdom for this to be achieved. Consisting of 7 different levels, the brothers have to face obstacles along the way, along with avoiding death in the process which will result in starting the whole level again after a set number of lives.

The UI in super Mario bro can be described as minimalistic. By only providing the necessary element to the player during gameplay such as the number of coins accumulated, how many lives are left for each player, the remaining amount left before the level has ended, and a pause button that when clicked on also displays a UI screen that gives the options of leaving the game, save the level and a settings option to control sound. Portrayed in a cartoonish manner the game is able to be played by a wide range of age groups.

| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coin system           | Having a coin system provides the player with additional objectives to complete throughout the level. Moreover, the coins collected by the player can be used to buy in-game items (like cosmetics)                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Clear user interface  | The clear user interface will enable the player to spend less time navigating the start screen and instead spend more time on the game itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Power-ups             | With the implementation of power-ups it provides the player additional abilities to fight enemies or jump high to reach places                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Death mechanism       | Even though I mentioned that there is not be an endless death system there should be a death system in place . By having a death system the player it forced to make choices on things like which path to take and weather should they priorities getting coin or completing the level itself.Fuhtermore the player shold only have three live with the abilty to gain back or an extra live withe the power ups  |
