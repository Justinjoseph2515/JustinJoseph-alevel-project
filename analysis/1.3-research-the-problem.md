### Aspect 1 (of 2-4 aspects per solution?)

### controls&#x20;

Being developed for the web browser , the games input controls are simple . The keys : A,S,D,W are allocated for water girl whilst the arrow keys are allocated for fire boy . I aim to incorporate a similar input button layout method for my video game as it will make it simple for the players to interact with .&#x20;
