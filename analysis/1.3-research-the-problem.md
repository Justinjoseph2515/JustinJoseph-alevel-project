![this image is a accurate depiction  of the video game am taking inspiration from ](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

### overview&#x20;

Fire boy and water girl is developed in 2009 by Oslo albert. Comprising of 32 levels , the objective of both players is to get to the exit gate with out falling in to each others  element or falling in to green substance ( that looks like acid ) whilst jumping on the platforms , pushing block on to buttons to unlock doors and pushing lever . with the ability to be multiplayer &#x20;



### Aspect 1 (of 2-4 aspects per solution?)

### controls&#x20;

Being developed for the web browser, the game input controls are simple. The keys: A, S, D and W are allocated for the water girl whilst the arrow keys are allocated for the fire boy. I aim to incorporate a similar input button layout method for my video game as it will make it simple for the players to interact.

### story and design&#x20;

There appears to be not much of a vast storyline in fire boy and water girl. Neither the less it seems to be set in a temple environment to guide the characters out of the temple while collecting gems along the way. To complete every level ( comprising of 32 levels ) you would have to solve simple puzzles during the game, such as pushing a block onto a scale sort of thing where the other character can go up and the block goes down. As a risk element, the game incorporates pools of liquid whereby each element character can only go through their own element and both of them can not enter a green substance; doing so would lead to immediate death and both players would have to restart the level again.

&#x20;Moreover, the UI is designed in a mentalistic manner by only proving a pause button and a timer for the duration of the gameplay. The menu in the game provides the player with the option to start the game or go to gaming settings controls. Once entered, the game presents you with a map depicting the levels that you have completed and the next possible route. Finally, after the completion of a level, the colour will indicate how successfully you have completed the level.

| the lack of ablity to plug in an extra keybord  | even tho fireboy and water girl are ment to be played on one keyboard the game should also give the player the option to add a extra keyboard to help reduce game error as lots of mistakes that happen between player in the game is because they keep coming in contact of one another  |

## shadow blade +&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png>)

### Overview

Shadow blade + is a fast pace 2d platformer game , developed by Dead Mage . As part of the game, the player is requested to achieve the objectives that has been set by going through and against obstacles ( such as jumping over spikes , fighting bots and not to be vaporized by lasers ) .&#x20;

### Aspect 1 (of 2-4 aspects per solution?)

### controls&#x20;

As the game was developed for mobile devices, the controls are done in a simple manner. The player has the choice of either a swiping for movement or an arrow ( whilst B is used for jump ). To attack the player has the ability to use A. From experience, the use of the mobile control such as present in Shadow blade + is a fatiguing to use for a long period of time. As a result, I wish not to use it.

### story line and game design



The storyline of shadow blade + is based on a young adult who is on a mission to be the next shadow blade ninja. The player is tasked with the objective of getting the ninja character from the start of the level to exit without encountering death whilst defeating NPC that tries to block his path.

Moreover, when playing the game the player is presented with a simple UI displaying a stopwatch at the top centre of the play screen and a purse button on the top right of the play screen. when the game is loaded up the player has the option to go into the game by going through a level section page, displayed in a simple manner it enables easy navigation of the game.

| time based system                  | the time based system it can go two ways . A count down timer or a stopwatch  , the justification of having a count down timer is so that the player does not spend too much time of a particular section ,as well as giving additionally pressure  to the player which may heighten the gaming experience . whilst the stopwatch can help the play compare their current performance  their performance from the precious game .  |
| bot ( that can fight back )        |  i would like to incorporate bots into my game as it provide a challenge for  the player , as well as this , if the player is by themselves ( in single  player mode ) they will not feel lonely .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| health bar                         | the reason to having a health bar in my video game is to let the player know what sort  of health condition is the  characters as well as their opponent .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| traps , pits and moving obstacles  | the reason to include traps, pits and moving obstacles is to provide the game with additional difficulty. furthermore, by using traps, pits and moving obstacles in hidden places, it helps the player to be on edge of what could come next .                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| the endless death system        | Without a death system that has no end until the player completes the level, it will remove one of the risk factors compared to having a limited number of tries before you have failed a level and have to restart the level. |
