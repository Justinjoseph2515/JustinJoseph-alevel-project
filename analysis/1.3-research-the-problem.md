![this image is a accurate depiction  of the video game am taking inspiration from ](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

### overview&#x20;

Fire boy and water girl is developed in 2009 by Oslo albert. Comprising of 32 levels , the objective of both players is to get to the exit gate with out falling in to each others  element or falling in to green substance ( that looks like acid ) whilst jumping on the platforms , pushing block on to buttons to unlock doors and pushing lever . with the ability to be multiplayer &#x20;



### Aspect 1 (of 2-4 aspects per solution?)

### controls&#x20;

Being developed for the web browser , the games input controls are simple . The keys : A,S,D,W are allocated for water girl whilst the arrow keys are allocated for fire boy . I aim to incorporate a similar input button layout method for my video game as it will make it simple for the players to interact with .&#x20;

### story and design&#x20;

There appears to be not much of a vast story line in fire boy and water girl .Neither the less it seems to be set in a temple environment with the objective to guide the characters out of the temple whilst collecting gems along the way . To complete every level ( comprising of 32 of them ) you would have to solve simple puzzles during the game , such as pushing a block onto a scale sort of thing where the other character can go up and the block goes down . As a risk element the game incorporates pools of liquid where by each element character  can only go through there own element and both of them can not entre a green substance ; by doing so would lead to immediate death and both player would have to restart the level again. &#x20;

Moreover the UI is designed in a mentalistic manner by only proving a pause button and a timer for the duration of the game play . the menu in the game provides the player with the option to start the game or go to gaming setting controls . Once entered, the game  presents you with  a  map depicting the levels that you have completed and the next possible route. lastly , after the completion of a level the colour will illiterate how successfully you have completed the level .&#x20;
