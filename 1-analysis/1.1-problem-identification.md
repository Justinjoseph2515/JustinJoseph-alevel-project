# 1.1 Problem Identification

By doing video games as part of my coding project it will enable people to reduce their stress levels. This is because over the past two years the gaming sector has seen a surge of video games sales, which can be seen in the increased sale in the US where the sale has increased by 23% compared to 2019 (Epstein, A. 2020), this can be due to the effect of the covid-19 forcing people to self-isolate from their friends, family and the interaction with other people of which it has taking a mental toll on people’s ability to socialize.

Platformers are one type of game that has stood against the test of  time, this is evident with examples such as super Mario line up which  is renowned for being one of the best platformer games of all time; it was given this praise with the characteristic that makes a great video game: achievements, endless levels or quests, milestones to keep the happiness hormone ( dopamine ) flowing, exploration and urgency ( making the player in a rush to unlock multi levels )

Another point that should be taken into consideration is the effect that video games have on the players. As previously mentioned the happiness hormone dopamine has a big impact on the players them self; studies has shown that the more a player plays an game that they enjoy there will be an increase in the amount of dopamine released in the brain ,  which results in the player feeling more immersed into the game . Additionally, with players of video games being asked to isolate during lockdown it has evidentially   became increasing  more important for player to be able to socialise with each other  as it has been a natural primal instinct. This socializing behaviour can be illustrated with the example of the video game “ Among us” which has took off in popularity during  2020 with one of most important feature being communication between other players on the virtual platform . \
