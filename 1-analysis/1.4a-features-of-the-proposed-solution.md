# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics&#x20;

### controls&#x20;

The controls for my game are selected with the intension of being easy to interact with , whilst proving the necessary keys for movement and retaliation against enemies & obstacles . From research that was done from [1.3](../analysis/1.3-research-the-problem.md#fire-boy-and-water-girl) i have concluded that the keyboard is the best suited for my game   . With player one occupying the arrow key for movement along with O ,P for punches & kicks . Together with player 2 controls of  A,S,D,W  for movement jointly R,T for punches and kicks . The selection of these key provides a good separation for the both players who are playing on one keyboard as the intended  market audience for my game is under 16 years of age . It should be noted that with each additional key the is add for extra feature it will increase the complicity that of the controls thus decreasing the easy of use factors .&#x20;
