# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics&#x20;

### controls&#x20;

The controls for my game are selected with the intension of being easy to interact with , whilst proving the necessary keys for movement and retaliation against enemies & obstacles . From research that was done in [1.3](../analysis/1.3-research-the-problem.md#fire-boy-and-water-girl) i have concluded that the keyboard is the best suited for my game . With player one occupying the arrow key for movement along with O ,P for punches & kicks . Together with player 2 controls of wasd for movement jointly with R,T for punches and kicks . The selection of these key provides a good separation for the both players who are playing on one keyboard as the intended  market audience for my game is under 16 years of age  . It should be noted that with each additional key the is add for extra feature it will increase the complicity that of the controls thus decreasing the easy of use factors .&#x20;

### variable  players numbers (solo ,dual or multiplayer)&#x20;

As part of my game design l wish to  make my game to appeal to a  wide range of player. Due to this reason i wish that my  game can be played in three different styles of game play  : solo, dual or multiplayer. In the simplest version is solo, where by the player is required to fight bots by them self without being push or falling off into a pool of substance that has the ability to takeaway one life, whilst collecting  all  gems to be able to exit .The next style of game play is dual, this is when there are only two player in a local setting ( where they are using one computer to play my game ). In this scenario both players will fight a increased amount of  bots on a harder level ultimately forcing them to combine each others power up / ability to win over the bots whilst collecting the gems to  exit. Finally,  the last style of game play is multiplayer. This style of game play can be only done from only individual computers for each players subsequently, each player will have to fight against bots that will target each player specifically after which a big boss will enter the game for all of the players to him collectively once that is achieved the have to collect the gems by doing puzzles . As a added feature in the dual and multiplayer game modes there is additional complexity  added in terms of a hidden exit feature.   &#x20;

### multiplayer connecting&#x20;

For this to be achieved all of the players from different devices has to  join a system that has been  setup ( this can be server or a device where all of the player can player on , for example  the hosts pc ) . For the other players to join the game host will select a game map or  levels after which a large number will be generated by the game ; the game host will share this number by which means they chose . Following the distribution of the number , the other player will enter  these value onto a  multiplayer joining section of the game . the game will enter then  the players in the same starting point of the game host from which the player can play the game.&#x20;

### hidden exit&#x20;

To add to the game I have improve a aspect of a existing solution. With existing solutions ( such as fire boy and water girl) the exit is in a constant location such as in the corner of the level or in the centre. I plan to make the door appear in a random location on the map where the player can get to after completing the objective. This will be done by Selecting all of the location on the map where the player can reach   .Then after I would  assign a value from 0 to the number of selected locations . After all of the locations assigned a value  a random number general will output a value that will correspond to a location on the map subsequently revealing the door. To help the player find the door , the door itself can be set to be illuminate or arrows will appear on the screen pointing in the general location of the door on the map . Furthermore, on the dual and multiplayer game modes it can be set that the door appear in all different location as supposed to one location .&#x20;

### power ups&#x20;

Like any classical game , powers ups gives the character extra ability's such as increased speed , strength or jumping height  whilst limiting the time that character possesses these powers . Like wise , I also wish to implement  similar powers ups  at specific moments of the game ; this can be at the start , middles end of the level , I wish to do it in a manner where the power ups will appear near the character when it is  approached . With every power up comes with different ability, such an example of this would be when the player is fighting a bot on a moving platform , the power up will appear near the character offering extra jumping height and speed . &#x20;

To limit the over use and the duration of the power ups i would set a specific amount of power ups for each level in conjunction with a 15sec uses period followed by  a cool down period ( 2  minutes until the next power up) . Furthermore, to provide any value to the character I wish for the players to have a pleather of power ups to chose from such as : increased speed , jumping height , strength in addition to shield and  health regeneration .  An additional feature I would like to integrate with the power ups is a power bar displaying the duration left before the power up ends with a 5 second alert function as well as this a another bar will be shown displaying the cool down period until the&#x20;



### **levels and challenges**&#x20;

### game layout and design&#x20;

The level will be resented in a 2d platform space consisting of floating platforms, moving platforms ( which can be constantly moving or  it can be made into extra step to the other side by making it  be controlled by a lever / button ) and a break way platform (such that one a play stands on it then  jumps of it will disintegrated forcing the player to go onto the next platform and  there is no turning back ) .  The layout of the map will be designed in a way that the players will reach to a specific point in the level where to will go against the challenge of that level before the hidden exit appears. &#x20;

### obstacles&#x20;

For every level in the game, players will be challenged agonest obstles form the start to finish . For this to be achieved player will have to face different challenges that has the ability to takeaway on health point for the health bar . It should be noted that as the level get harder so does the obstacles .An example of this would be in level one there might be only a laser that turns on and off every so often but in level 10 there can be a pit with spikes at the bottom and whilst standing near it a spring loaded wall can try to push the player in. The obstacles that i have thought of to incorpacte into my game are : saws - that can have the ability to move up and down , enemies/bots , pits - where at the start with no spikes but later on with spikes as the player goes through the levels , laser- that turns off and on periorticly  and a spring loaded board - this can be in the floor of the platform or against the wall .&#x20;

&#x20;

### enemies&#x20;

Fighting enemies thorough out the level can provide a better gaming experience . This can only be achieved with the fighting bots having balanced ratio between  sticking damage and the health or the number of hit they can accumulate before by killed . For this  to sustainable the player will go through each level fighting bot that ranges from easy to hard ( the big boss will be on the highest level ) . To accommodate for the different  modes of game play sole , dual and multiplayer  the level of difficulty will be different between modes , for example the easy fighting  bot in solo will not be the same level of difficulty as it is in dual or multiplayer .&#x20;



### puzzles&#x20;

The puzzles that i have in mind will be interrogated into my game in the forms of buttons, levers and passcode gates . The players will have to corporate together in order to open gates , move blocks and temporally stop platform from a moving to stationary position and to let each other to pass through . Additionally the pass code gate requires one player to find the four digit code that is placed some where in the level  in a  whilst the other player fights against  bots to protect the exit gate ( if these gates are in one location) . By including puzzles in my game is provide positive stimuli for each play helping the playing to remain interested in the game.



### Side scrolling camera view ( shadow )&#x20;

The side scrolling camera view in most game is presented in a vast open style manner . However , in my game i aim to reduce the field of view from the player and let the player them self's explore the map , thus helping the player to be engaged for longer period of time as the player is egger to find out what is going to happen next ; once the player has explore the level by walking the place the player has walked will be lit up  . Furthermore by obscuring the level map from the player and  them in  shadow  state it help the level to appear more vast and open .&#x20;

#### graphics and  user experience / user interface

### user interface

&#x20;As most user interface are complex to navigation most complex game i aim to make my user interface easy to interact with helping to the player jump straight into the game . this will be done by presenting the player with a home page where where there will be one Centre button that will take the player straight into the game section where the player will be  presented by all  of the levels   one in this section the level the player is currently on will be illumined  ( additionally if the play is still on a same level when going back into the level select screen the   illumating  the level will appear different  compare to if it has been player or just completed  ). If you go back to the home page just below the Centre button is the other game modes " dual" & " multiplayer" . By selecting multiplayer another page will appear displaying the option to create a game or join a game.  &#x20;
