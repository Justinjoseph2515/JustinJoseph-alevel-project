# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics&#x20;

### controls&#x20;

The controls for my game are selected with the intension of being easy to interact with , whilst proving the necessary keys for movement and retaliation against enemies & obstacles . From research that was done in [1.3](../analysis/1.3-research-the-problem.md#fire-boy-and-water-girl) i have concluded that the keyboard is the best suited for my game . With player one occupying the arrow key for movement along with O ,P for punches & kicks . Together with player 2 controls of  A,S,D,W  for movement jointly with R,T for punches and kicks . The selection of these key provides a good separation for the both players who are playing on one keyboard as the intended  market audience for my game is under 16 years of age  . It should be noted that with each additional key the is add for extra feature it will increase the complicity that of the controls thus decreasing the easy of use factors .&#x20;

### variable  players numbers (solo ,dual or multiplayer)&#x20;

As part of my game design  i wish to  make my game to appeal to a  wide range of player . Due to this reason the game can be played in three different styles  : solo , dual or multiplayer  .  in the simples version is solo  , where by the player is required to fight  bots by them self without being push or falling off into a pool of substance that has the ability to takeaway one life , whilst collecting gems to be able to exit . &#x20;
