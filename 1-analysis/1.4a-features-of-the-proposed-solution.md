# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics&#x20;

### controls&#x20;

The controls for my game are selected with the intension of being easy to interact with , whilst proving the necessary keys for movement and retaliation against enemies & obstacles . From research that was done in [1.3](../analysis/1.3-research-the-problem.md#fire-boy-and-water-girl) i have concluded that the keyboard is the best suited for my game . With player one occupying the arrow key for movement along with O ,P for punches & kicks . Together with player 2 controls of  A,S,D,W  for movement jointly with R,T for punches and kicks . The selection of these key provides a good separation for the both players who are playing on one keyboard as the intended  market audience for my game is under 16 years of age  . It should be noted that with each additional key the is add for extra feature it will increase the complicity that of the controls thus decreasing the easy of use factors .&#x20;

### variable  players numbers (solo ,dual or multiplayer)&#x20;

As part of my game design l wish to  make my game to appeal to a  wide range of player. Due to this reason i wish that my  game can be played in three different styles of game play  : solo, dual or multiplayer. In the simplest version is solo, where by the player is required to fight bots by them self without being push or falling off into a pool of substance that has the ability to takeaway one life, whilst collecting  all  gems to be able to exit .The next style of game play is dual, this is when there are only two player in a local setting ( where they are using one computer to play my game ). In this scenario both players will fight a increased amount of  bots on a harder level ultimately forcing them to combine each others power up / ability to win over the bots whilst collecting the gems to  exit. Finally,  the last style of game play is multiplayer. This style of game play can be only done from only individual computers for each players subsequently, each player will have to fight against bots that will target each player specifically after which a big boss will enter the game for all of the players to him collectively once that is achieved the have to collect the gems by doing puzzles . As a added feature in the dual and multiplayer game modes there is additional complexity  added in terms of a hidden exit feature.   &#x20;

### multiplayer connecting&#x20;

For this to be achieved all of the players from different devices has to  join a system that has been  setup ( this can be server or a device where all of the player can player on , for example  the hosts pc ) . For the other players to join the game host will select a game map or  levels after which a large number will be generated by the game ; the game host will share this number by which means they chose . Following the distribution of the number , the other player will enter  these value onto a  multiplayer joining section of the game . the game will enter then  the players in the same starting point of the game host from which the player can play the game.&#x20;

### hidden exit&#x20;
