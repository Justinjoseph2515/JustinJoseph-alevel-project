# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics&#x20;

### controls&#x20;

The controls for my game are selected with the intension of being easy to interact with , whilst proving the necessary keys for movement and retaliation against enemies & obstacles . From research that was done in [1.3](../analysis/1.3-research-the-problem.md#fire-boy-and-water-girl) i have concluded that the keyboard is the best suited for my game . With player one occupying the arrow key for movement along with O ,P for punches & kicks . Together with player 2 controls of  A,S,D,W  for movement jointly with R,T for punches and kicks . The selection of these key provides a good separation for the both players who are playing on one keyboard as the intended  market audience for my game is under 16 years of age  . It should be noted that with each additional key the is add for extra feature it will increase the complicity that of the controls thus decreasing the easy of use factors .&#x20;

### variable  players numbers (solo ,dual or multiplayer)&#x20;

As part of my game design  i wish to  make my game to appeal to a  wide range of player . Due to this reason the game can be played in three different styles  : solo , dual or multiplayer  .  in the simples version is solo  , where by the player is required to fight  bots by them self without being push or falling off into a pool of substance that has the ability to takeaway one life , whilst collecting  all  gems to be able to exit . The next style of game play is dual , this is when there are only two player in a local setting ( where they are using one computer to play my game ). In this scenario  both players will fight a increased amount of  bots on a harder level ultimately forcing them to combine each others power up / ability to win over the bots whilst collecting the gems to  exit . Finally,  the last style of game play is multiplayer . This style of game play can be only done from only individual computers for each players subsequently, each player will have to fight against bots that will target each player specifically &#x20;
