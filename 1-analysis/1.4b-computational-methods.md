# 1.4b Computational Methods

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is the methodology of removing unnecessary details from an issue. For my purpose abstraction would be used to help me remove unnecessary detail that will not affect my game's performance (such as the graphics, sound, and dialogue). Thus I would shift my focus to the core aspects of my game. This includes:&#x20;















## Thinking Ahead

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of taking an overwhelming  problem and then breaking the problem down into sub problems after which sub problems can be solved individually whilst ranking each problem by importance. This will enable to solve the overwhelming problem at a manageable rate .

I intend to use this very method theough out the development pahses  of my coding project. As mentioaned in my last pharagrph i will achived this by spliting the wholse game into induvailly compents which togethoer makes the whole game .
