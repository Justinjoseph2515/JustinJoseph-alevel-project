# 1.4b Computational Methods

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualization

Abstraction is the methodology of removing unnecessary details from an issue. For my purpose abstraction would be used to help me remove unnecessary detail that will not affect my game's performance (such as the graphics, sound, and dialogue). Thus I would shift my focus to the core aspects of my game. This includes the following:



## Thinking Ahead



## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of taking an overwhelming problem and then breaking the problem down into sub-problems after which the sub-problems can be solved individually whilst ranking each problem by importance. This will enable us to solve the overwhelming problem at a manageable rate.

I intend to use this very method throughout the development phases of my coding project. As mentioned in my last paragraph I will achieve this by splitting the whole game into individual components (for example the movement of the player, coin system, obstacle, and so on) after which I will deal with each component on an individual level by further breaking the component into individual tasks, thereafter enabling me to complete each task in a step by step action. Thus splitting the whole game into manageable levels will enable me to complete the game in an efficient and timely manner. All of the components of the game will be mentioned in the success criteria and in the design frame, whilst the task will be mentioned in each development cycle.



## Thinking Logically

Thinking logically is the act of analysing a problem and providing a solid solution to the situation. This is very appreciable with my game, ensuring that the game follows a logical process to provide a good game experience for the player.&#x20;

## Thinking Concurrently

Thinking concurrently is the process of accomplishing more than two tasks simultaneously in a given time frame. Completing multiple tasks in one go can increase the efficiency of the program whilst saving time, which enables the PC to shift its focus onto more power-intensive aspects of the game. For the purposes of my game the example of two more tasks that can be run "behind the scenes "  simultaneously could be :

* When the player comes in contact with an obstacle, the game checks if contact has been made whilst reducing the health of the player at the same time.
* Checking if the player had fallen off whilst on a moving platform.&#x20;
* When the player and the enemy are in the same frame but both would be able to move independently of each other.
