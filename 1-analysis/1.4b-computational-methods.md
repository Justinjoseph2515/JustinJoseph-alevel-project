# 1.4b Computational Methods

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualization

Abstraction is the methodology of removing unnecessary details from an issue. For my purpose abstraction would be used to help me remove unnecessary detail that will not affect my game's performance (such as the graphics, sound, and dialogue). Thus I would shift my focus to the core aspects of my game. This includes:&#x20;















## Thinking Ahead

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of taking an overwhelming  problem and then breaking the problem down into sub problems after which sub problems can be solved individually whilst ranking each problem by importance. This will enable to solve the overwhelming problem at a manageable rate .

I intend to use this very method theough out the development pahses  of my coding project. As mentioned in my last paragraph i will achieved this by splitting the whole game into induvailly compents which together makes the whole game (for example the movement of the player, coin system , obstacle and so-on ) after which i will deal with each compont on a indually level by breaking the compent into induvally tasks , there after enabling me to complete each task in a step by step action. Thus by spliting the whole game into mangeable levels it will enable me to compelte the game with in a effenct and timely manner. All of the compents of the game will be mentioned in the success criteria and in the desing frame . whislt the taks will be mentioned in the each development cycle.&#x20;



## Thinking Logically

Thinking logically is the act of analyzing a problem and provinding a solid soluction to the situation. This is very apparenable with my game , ensuring that the game follows a process to provide a good game experience for the player.&#x20;

## Thinking Concurrently

Thinking concurrently is the process of accompletioning more then two tasks simuomtaiotly in a given time frame. By completing a plather of tasks in one go it  increase the efficentice of the program.  Additionally it provides a useful way to same time whuch enables for the pc to shifts its foucs onto more power intenvie aspecrs of the game . For the purposes of the my game the exmple of  two more takss that can be ran "behind the scene " simuonyasly could be : :thumbsup:
