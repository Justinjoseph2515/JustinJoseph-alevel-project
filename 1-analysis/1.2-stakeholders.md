# 1.2 Stakeholders

In 2021 it has been estimated that there is 3.24 billion gamers in the world, with most of the gamers being on the younger end of the spectrum. This entices me to make a 2d platformer game that will be in designed in a casual and entertaining manner. This will enable me to successfully appeal to the demographic that I am aiming at (the young audience, 7+)

I aim to target my project at an age demographic of PEGI 12 as this is the most optimal demographic considering the fact it is a moderately sized market (of 21% in PEGI  12) with the opportunity to grow in terms of market share [( isfe key facts ) ](../reference-page.md)&#x20;
