# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

For my&#x20;

| Criterion | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 20        | The game should be able to run smoothly at 30 fps |
| 22        | The code should run without any errors            |

### Criterion 20

Running the game at a minimum of 30 fps was a necessity as it provided a good gameplay experience by not having choppy or slow-looking graphics. To ensure that my game met the minimum criterion I utilized the built-in fps monitor in kaboom.js, by pressing F1 the rate at which the game was playing appeared. As the image below indicates the game runs at a constant 60 fps which surpasses the requirement of 30 fps.&#x20;

## Criterion 22

For a complete game the last objective would be for the player to be able to run the game without crashing. To ensure that the game I present to the player is robust, functional and is up to a good standard, I aim to carry out a multitude of tests by putting the each section game under different levels of stress. The fact that when I put the game under different levels of stress the game did not break or crash, ultimately shows the robustness of the game. However whilst putting the game under the stress I managed to find some bugs which could unintentional make the levels hard for the player or may lead to a degraded user experience .&#x20;

1. When playing the game I found that the hitbox of the coin and spikes will often overlap if they are placed in close proximity which leads to the player dying whilst trying to collect the coins.
2. Additionally, I found that when the player reach the exit of the first level and go onto the sequent levels the stopwatch will reset at the start of each level instead of continuing to  record the time in the subsequent levels.
3. Finally, when the player comes in contact with the moving platform from the side the platform would stop and go back from the way it came from, instead of continuing of its designated path.
