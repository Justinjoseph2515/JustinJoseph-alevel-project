# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

For my&#x20;

| Criterion | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 20        | The game should be able to run smoothly at 30 fps |
| 22        | The code should run without any errors            |

### Criterion 20

Running the game at a minimum of 30 fps was a necessity as it provided a good gameplay experience by not having choppy or slow-looking graphics. To ensure that my game met the minimum criterion I utilized the built-in fps monitor in kaboom.js, by pressing F1 the rate at which the game was playing appeared. As the image below indicates the game runs at a constant 60 fps which surpasses the requirement of 30 fps.&#x20;

## criterion 22

For a complete game the last objective would be for the player to be able to run the game without crashing. To ensure that the game i present to the player is robust, functional and is up to a good standard, I aim to carry out a multitude of tests by putting the each section game under different levels of stress.  The fact that when I put the game under different levels of stress the game did not break or crash,  ultimately shows the robustness of the game. However whilst putting the game under the stress i manage to find some bugs.
