# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Did you understand the objective of the game? Were you able to get to the exit and complete the level?                            |
| 2 - Efficient      | When you died did you know what to do afterwards? Was it simple for you to get to the start screen or restart the level?          |
| 3 - Engaging       | Did you find the game fun? Were the colours used throughout the game to your liking? Were the levels too difficult or too easy?   |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did the game crash? Did the game run smoothly? Did you find any bugs in the game? If there were any bugs what were they?          |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Are the controls of the game easy to understand? Was the menu simple enough that you would navigate through it effortlessly?      |

Listed below are the results of the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation.

### User Feedback

### **Effective**

**Question 1**&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Understanding the objective of the game is one of the most important aspects of it. This is because without understanding the game or its objective playing it would not be possible. From the question above that was presented to a few candidates, it is apparent that the vast majority understood the objective of the game.&#x20;

**Question 2**



<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p> </p></figcaption></figure>

The results above show that 87.5% of the users of the game found the game achievable and were able to complete the game in its entirety, however 12.5 % of the users of the game "disagreed" in the ability of completing the level this shows that there is an area for me to improve the game which I believe it can be done by adding arrows or clues throughout the game to show the way out.

### Efficient

**Question 3**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

By providing a straight forwards and simple menu when the player dies it can enable for a better user experience thus being able to retain the player continue the game. The results of the question asked shows that all the player understand what to do when they die this shows that I have met the criteria I set for my game .&#x20;

### Engaging

**Question 4**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The main factor of the a successful game is if the player can be entertained by the game or find enjoyment out of the game. The response from the player shows that 75% of the response is either "strongly agree" or "agree", this shows that my game have achieved one of the main criteria in 1.1. However, the 25 % of the player whose response is a "disagree" show that there are part of the game where I can improve upon the increase the overall response to be positive is to provide a  solution to the game not being fun this could be done by adding more obstacles or objective for the player to complete.

**Question 5**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The result of this questions show that the vast majority of results is positive, however the 12.5 % of responses disagree with the colour of the game. This is subjective as the user who responded has expressed their opinion based on their interests.

**Question 6**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As stated in 1.5 one the main requirement I had was to create 3 levels that got progressively harder. The results of the question shows that the levels designed for the game are appropriately challenging, with 62.5% of responses stating that the levels are difficult and a further 12.5% saying the levels are very difficult. However, 25% of responses stated that they did not find the levels challenging in any capacity.

### Error tolerant

**Question 7**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The results of this question was excellent as it shows that the game will run under any stress level without any failing&#x20;

**Question 8**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Even tho that the game ran without crashing there are bug in the game which has also been spoted by the players. From the short answer responses it is appear the bug that i mange to identify during the testing in 3.1 was still not resolved, with the main bug being that when the player comes in contact with a coin next to a spike the player dies, this is the result of the hit box of the coin and obstacle overlaying. It as also been mentioned that the performance of game will go down once the player has died or completed the levels. As these are the prominent bugs with the game it is with up most improtant i fix these issues before the game is ready fro anybody to play as it could degrade the players expeereince with the game .&#x20;

### Easy to learn&#x20;

**Question 9**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One of the main success criteria of my game is to ensure that my game is easy to interact with . My game uses the controls of "a", "d" and space this has prove very sufficient for my game has 87.5% found the controls simple to understand and use during the game. However the can improved by adding different type of inputs or changing the location of the controls itself.&#x20;

**Question 10**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One of my main success criteria of the game is to ensure that the menu for the game is simple to use. From the results above it shows that the menu implemented in the game is simple to use with 100 percent of responses strongly agreeing.&#x20;

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 21        | Should be age appropriate pegi 12           |
| 8         | have simple control                         |
| 3         | The levels get progressively more difficult |

### Criterion 21

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As I stated in 1.5 I wanted the game to be suitable for a player aged 12 and up. This is to ensure that the player is competent enough to understand the aim of game. In order for the game to be suitable for a 12 year old the game must not to promote violence or contain any vulgar or explicit content. It is clear from the result the above that all users who answered the questionnaire believed that the game is appropriate for players above the age of 12 years old. Therefore this criteria was met.

## Criterion 8

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The response to this question is given in question 9



## Criterion 3
