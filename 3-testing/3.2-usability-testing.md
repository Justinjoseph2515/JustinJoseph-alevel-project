## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Did you understand the objective of the game? Were you able to get to the exit and complete the level?                            |
| 2 - Efficient      | When you died did you know what to do afterwards? Was it simple for you to get to the start screen or restart the level?          |
| 3 - Engaging       | Did you find the game fun? Were the colours used throughout the game to your liking? Were the levels too difficult or too easy?   |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did the game crash? Did the game run smoothly? Did you find any bugs in the game? If there were any bugs what were they?          |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Are the controls of the game easy to understand? Was the menu simple enough that you would navigate through it effortlessly?      |

Listed below are the results of the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation.
