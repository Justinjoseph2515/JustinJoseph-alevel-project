## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Did you understand the objective of the game? Were you able to get to the exit and complete the level?                            |
| 2 - Efficient      | When you died did you know what to do afterwards? Was it simple for you to get to the start screen or restart the level?          |
| 3 - Engaging       | Did you find the game fun? Were the colours used throughout the game to your liking? Were the levels too difficult or too easy?   |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did the game crash? Did the game run smoothly? Did you find any bugs in the game? If there were any bugs what were they?          |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Are the controls of the game easy to understand? Was the menu simple enough that you would navigate through it effortlessly?      |

Listed below are the results of the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation.

### User Feedback

### **Effective**

From the question above presented to candidates, it is apparent that the vast majority understood the objective of the game.&#x20;

The results above shows that 87.5% of the user of the game found the game achievable and was able to complete the game in its entirety, however 12.5 % of the user of the game "disagreed" in the ability of completing the level this shows that there is an area for me to improve the game which i believe it can be done by adding pointers or clues thorugh out the game show the way out.

### Efficient

**Question 3**

By providing  a straight forwards and simple menu when the player dies it can enable for a better user experience thus being able to retain the player continue the game . The results of the question asked shows that all the player understand what to do when they die this shows that i  have met the cretia i set for my game .&#x20;

The result of this questions show that the vast majority of results is positive, however the 12.5 % of responses disagree with the colour of the game . This is subjective as the user who responded has expressed their opinion based on their interests .

**Question 8**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The result of this question is great to see as it shows that the game is road bust subsequently the games funderments will work in any stress load on a pleater of devices.&#x20;

**Question 9**

One of main success criteria of my game is to ensure that my game is easy to interact with . My game uses the controls of "a", "d" and space this has prove very sufficient for my game has 87.5% found the controls stimple to understand and use during the game. However the can improved by adding different type of inputs or changing the location of the controls itself.&#x20;
