# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

They could be plucked from the tests in your dev cycles, or be new tests that run the system as a whole.

## Tests

cycle 1

| Test | Instructions           | What I expect                                                                                                                                    | What actually happens                                                                                                                       | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Movement               | When I press "A" the player moves left and when I press "D" the player move right. Also when "Space bar" is pressed the character  should jump.  | When I use the controls the player disappears from the screen.                                                                              | Fail      |
| 2    | Movement (second  try) | when I press "A" the player moves left and when I press "D" the player move right. Also when "Space bar" is pressed the character  should jump.  | When I press "A" the character moves left. when i press "D" the character move right. Finally when i press "Space bar" the character jumps. | Pass      |
| 3    | Platform               | The player should be able to stand, move and jump on the platform without falling through it.                                                    | The character was able to stand and move on the platform                                                                                    | Pass      |

these tests show that the character in the game is fully functional, with the character being able to move in all direction ( left, right up and down) as well as this the character is also able to jump on to platforms and moving on them without fall through.&#x20;



### cycle 2&#x20;

| Test | Instructions | What I expect                                                                                                                                          | What actually happens                                                                                                                                                                       | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | The camera   | When I move the player left, right, up and down the camera should follow them in that direction.                                                       | The camera will follow the player when they move left and right. However when the player wants to jump up or go down the camera will not follow the player.                                 | Fail      |
| 2    | The camera   | When I move the player left, right, up and down the camera should follow them in that direction.                                                       | In my second try the camera will follow the player in any direction the player moves in the game.                                                                                           | Pass      |
| 3    | The coin     | When the coin is added it will hover  above the ground and be in scale with respect to the rest of the map.                                            | I added the coin to my game however it was scaled too big in respect to the background.                                                                                                     | Fail      |
| 4    | The coin     | When the coin is added it will hover above the ground and be in scale with respect to the rest of the map.                                             | When I rewrote the code I added a scale factor to alter the size of the coin and now the coin is the perfect size ratio to the background as well that the coin hovers above the platform.  | Pass      |
| 5    | The coin     | When the player goes in contact with coins the coin should disappear and be added to the scoreboard which the player can see whilst playing the game.  | When the player comes in contact with the coins, the coins are collected and added to the scoreboard.                                                                                       | Pass      |

### Evidence

As the purpose of this cycle was to add coins to the game, an issue I encountered during the development phase was ensuring that the coin will stay in the correct position which was later resolved. After the on of the other requirement i had was that the coin will disappear when contact is made and the coins collected should be added up and displayed to the player on the top right and side which has been achieved. Overall for the coin function I can be considered a success as it passes all of the tests.







Secondly, a function that was needed for my game  was for moving the camera that will follow the character around when the game was running from the video above function of the moving camera can be considered a success as it achieves the task of following the player around the game without fail.&#x20;

cycle 3&#x20;

| Test | Instructions                       | What I expect                                                                                                               | What actually happens                                                                                                | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Added the spikes                   | The spikes will function in a manner where when the user comes in contact with the spikes the player should fail the level  | The spikes were added successfully however when the player comes in contact with the spikes the player does not die  | Fail      |
| 2    | Added the spikes (second attempt)  | The spikes will function in a manner where when the user comes in contact with the spikes the player should fails the level | After the some alteration to the code when the player comes in contact with  the spikes the player fails the level   | pass      |

From the images above the function of the obstacle shows that it works as intended in which when the player comes in contact with an obstacle in this case spikes the player would fail the level and will be shown the loose scene which takes the player back to the main menu to start the game again.

### cycle 4

| Test | Instructions         | What I expect                                                                                                                                        | What actually happens                                                                                                   | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | stopwatch appearing  | when player start the game the stopwatch show appear in the designated location                                                                      | The stopwatch appears in the designated location however the when recording time it does  not separated from the text   | fail      |
| 2    | Stopwatch working    | When the player starts the game the stopwatch will start and once the player has completed he game by finishing the level the stop watch will stop.  | The stopwatch worked as expected.                                                                                       | Pass      |
