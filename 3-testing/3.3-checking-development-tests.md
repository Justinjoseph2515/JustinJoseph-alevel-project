# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

They could be plucked from the tests in your dev cycles, or be new tests that run the system as a whole.

## Tests

cycle 1

| Test | Instructions           | What I expect                                                                                                                                    | What actually happens                                                                                                                       | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Movement               | When I press "A" the player moves left and when I press "D" the player move right. Also when "Space bar" is pressed the character  should jump.  | When I use the controls the player disappears from the screen.                                                                              | Fail      |
| 2    | Movement (second  try) | when I press "A" the player moves left and when I press "D" the player move right. Also when "Space bar" is pressed the character  should jump.  | When I press "A" the character moves left. when i press "D" the character move right. Finally when i press "Space bar" the character jumps. | Pass      |
| 3    | Platform               | The player should be able to stand, move and jump on the platform without falling through it.                                                    | The character was able to stand and move on the platform                                                                                    | Pass      |

**Evidence**

These tests show that the character in the game is fully functional, with the character being able to move in all directions (left, right, up, and down) as well as being able to jump onto platforms and move on them without falling through.&#x20;



### cycle 2&#x20;

| Test | Instructions | What I expect                                                                                                                                          | What actually happens                                                                                                                                                                       | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | The camera   | When I move the player left, right, up and down the camera should follow them in that direction.                                                       | The camera will follow the player when they move left and right. However when the player wants to jump up or go down the camera will not follow the player.                                 | Fail      |
| 2    | The camera   | When I move the player left, right, up and down the camera should follow them in that direction.                                                       | In my second try the camera will follow the player in any direction the player moves in the game.                                                                                           | Pass      |
| 3    | The coin     | When the coin is added it will hover  above the ground and be in scale with respect to the rest of the map.                                            | I added the coin to my game however it was scaled too big in respect to the background.                                                                                                     | Fail      |
| 4    | The coin     | When the coin is added it will hover above the ground and be in scale with respect to the rest of the map.                                             | When I rewrote the code I added a scale factor to alter the size of the coin and now the coin is the perfect size ratio to the background as well that the coin hovers above the platform.  | Pass      |
| 5    | The coin     | When the player goes in contact with coins the coin should disappear and be added to the scoreboard which the player can see whilst playing the game.  | When the player comes in contact with the coins, the coins are collected and added to the scoreboard.                                                                                       | Pass      |

### Evidence

As the purpose of this cycle was to add coins to the game, an issue I encountered during the development phase was ensuring that the coin will stay in the correct position which was later resolved. Afterwards, one of the other requirements I had was that the coin will disappear when contact is made and the coins collected should be added up and displayed to the player on the top right and side which has been achieved. Overall for the coin function I can be considered a success as it passes all of the tests.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

you can see from this image that when the player comes in contact with coin , the coin will disappear and it will be add to the score on the top left .&#x20;





Secondly, a function that was needed for my game  was for moving the camera that will follow the character around when the game was running  the function of the moving camera can be considered a success as it achieves the task of following the player around the game without fail.&#x20;

### cycle 3

| Test | Instructions                       | What I expect                                                                                                               | What actually happens                                                                                                | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Added the spikes                   | The spikes will function in a manner where when the user comes in contact with the spikes the player should fail the level  | The spikes were added successfully however when the player comes in contact with the spikes the player does not die  | Fail      |
| 2    | Added the spikes (second attempt)  | The spikes will function in a manner where when the user comes in contact with the spikes the player should fails the level | After the some alteration to the code when the player comes in contact with  the spikes the player fails the level   | pass      |

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the images above the function of the obstacle shows that it works as intended in which when the player comes in contact with an obstacle in this case spikes the player would fail the level and will be shown the loose scene which takes the player back to the main menu to start the game again.

Cycle 4:

| Test | Instructions         | What I expect                                                                                                                                        | What actually happens                                                                                                   | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | stopwatch appearing  | when player start the game the stopwatch show appear in the designated location                                                                      | The stopwatch appears in the designated location however the when recording time it does  not separated from the text   | fail      |
| 2    | Stopwatch working    | When the player starts the game the stopwatch will start and once the player has completed he game by finishing the level the stop watch will stop.  | The stopwatch worked as expected.                                                                                       | Pass      |

&#x20;&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Form the image above you can the stopwatch was added successfully the only buging being that there is no space between counting part and the text " stopwatch". apart from that it is functionally successful with the downfall of it being the appearance to the player&#x20;

### cycle 5

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                     | What I expect                                                                                                                                                        | What actually happens                                                                                                                                                                                     | Pass/Fail |

| 1    | run the code                     | the to appear where it is placed on the map as well has eleimate the player if the player comes in contect with the enemy                                            | the player gets eliminated by the enemy when contact is made as well a the enemy appear on the selected location.                                                                                         | pass      |
| 2    | movement run test                | after the basics of the enemy is established, i am now test if the enemy will move from in the designated area . such as a patrol of the area                        | the enemy moves around . However the enemy when placed on a platform the enemy falles if the platform                                                                                                     | fail      |
| 3    | movement run test  ( second try) | after the basics of the enemy is established, i am now test if the enemy will move from in the designated area in a specific pattern . such as a patrol of the area  | After seen the failiure of the fisrt test i went back to the code and altered the distant that the enemy can travel once that was done the enemy can movie around on the platform with out falling of it  | pass      |

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From this you can see the enemy appear on the game screen for the player to interact in which the enemy was successful add and it was  able to move toward me at a reasonable speed&#x20;

| 1    | Run code              | When the platforms move they should move from left to right and once they come in contact with the solid platform they should go the other way   | The platform works but not in the expected way. This is because when the platform moves from left to right it goes through the solid platform instead of bouncing back and going the way it came                                                                                                    | Fail      |
|      |                       | When the platform moves, they should move from left to right and once they come in contact with the solid platform, they should go the other way | After the first test failed I went into the code of the moving platform I found that I did not include the solid() function which allows the moving platform to be known as a solid. Once it was added, the platform goes left and right as expected                                                | Pass      |
|      | Run code with player  | For this test, I wanted to see how the platform interacts with the player                                                                        | Through the test I found that there is bug with the platform. In which the player can make contact with the side of the moving platform as a substitute for the solid platform and the moving platform would think it had made contact with a solid platform.                                       | Fail      |
|      | Run code with player  | For this test, I wanted to see how the platform interacts with the player                                                                        | When doing the last test I found a bug (mentioned in test 3). However whilst conducting other tests on the moving platform the result of it was fine as it allowed the player to jump on it as well move around on it with out causing any direct issue to the moving platform whilst in operation  | Pass      |

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you can see from the two images above the moving platform was successful . as well being fully functional . With the only issue that was found being that the moving platform would bonus back if contact is made from the side by a player. which yet has not been sloved. &#x20;

&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

the portal was successfully added to the game and when i went though it took me to the next level as expected&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

when i went though the last portal of the game i was greeted by a win scene to show that i have complete the game successfully&#x20;

| 1    | Falling death  | When the player falls outside of the level the player should die and the death screen should show after a certain distance of falling.  | When the player strays too far away from the platfrom , they will die after a short distance.                                                                                      | Fail      |
| 2    | Falling death  | When the player falls outside of the level the player should die and the death screen should show after a certain distance of falling.  | When the player jumps off the level, the player is dead when they go below the base floor of the game as well as that the player will die if they are falling for a long distance. | Pass      |
| 3    | Death scene    | When the player collides with a dangerous object, the death screen should appear.                                                       | When the player dies the death screen appears.                                                                                                                                     | Pass      |

As i am unable to record i can say that the falling death feature works from test and when the player jumps from a high or fall of the side of the game the falling death feature actives . As a prove of this when the player dies from falling of high the image below is shown

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (22) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

this test was successful due to the fact that when the player dies from anything that it is categorized as danger the death screen shows up indicating to the player that the game has ended.

when the game is load the player will first see the menu this has worked as intended  the player is taken to the desired location . the bug i just released was the miss alignment of the text on the how to play scene. This is a easy fix , for the reason that the function pos() will enable me to move the text around . there fore the test was a success
