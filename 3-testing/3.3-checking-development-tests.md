# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

They could be plucked from the tests in your dev cycles, or be new tests that run the system as a whole.

## Tests

cycle 1

| Test | Instructions           | What I expect                                                                                                                                  | What actually happens                                                                                                                      | Pass/Fail |
